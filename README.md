A collection of Genetic Algorithms that uses [Qt](https://www.qt.io) and [qtcustomplot](http://qcustomplot.com/) for data visualization.
The goal of this project is to create a benchmark software for genetic algorithms. Currently, there is only one sample algorithm that calculates the minimum distance in the simplest way. Everyone can contribute and add their own class to the project.


In order to use plotting functionality in your class just use Plot() function which is implemented in the interface class. There is a sample use case in minDistance class.
